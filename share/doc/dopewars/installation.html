<h1>Obtaining and installing dopewars</h1>

<p>The dopewars source code and precompiled binaries (in RPM format) are
available from the main dopewars web page,
at <a href="https://dopewars.sourceforge.io/">
https://dopewars.sourceforge.io/</a>. Just follow the link from
there to the download section. "rpm" is the RedHat Package Manager, a program
for simplifying installation and upgrade of programs, and is part of the
RedHat Linux distribution. If you are using a different distribution, it
may be still be included, however. If you do not want to use "rpm", or the
installation fails, then you can obtain the source code tarball and recompile
the code from scratch.</p>

<p><b>Prerequisites:</b> dopewars relies on the GLib library for all builds;
this library is used for parsing the configuration files, network and string
handling, and many other purposes. On a Windows system, this is the only
prequisite; the standard Windows libraries are used for everything else. On a
Unix/Linux system, you will also need the screen library curses (or the
equivalent, such as ncurses or cur_colr) for the text-mode client, and the
<a href="http://www.gtk.org/">GTK+</a> libraries for the graphical client.</p>

</ul>

<h2><a id="win32">Windows installation</a></h2>
<p>The easiest way to install the Windows version is to download the Windows
installer program from the
<a href="https://dopewars.sourceforge.io/download.html">download page</a>, and
run it (either instruct your web browser to "run from the current location",
or save it to somewhere obvious like the Desktop and then double-click on its
icon later). This should install all relevant files, and set up Start Menu
icons, etc. If, however, you wish to build the program from the source code,
see the <a href="#tarball">tarball installation</a> section below, and also
see the <a href="windows.html">Windows page</a>.</p>

<h2><a id="rpmbinary">RPM binary installation</a></h2>
<p>The binary RPMs are built for Intel systems running RedHat or Fedora Linux.
On other systems, these binary RPMs may refuse to install, or may run but then
crash with mysterious segmentation faults due to library conflicts.</p>

<ol>
<li>Download the 
<a href="http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/dopewars/dopewars-1.6.2-1.el7.x86_64.rpm">
x86_64 (64-bit Intel for RedHat Enterprise 7)</a> RPM with your web browser.</li>

<li>Become root on your Unix box (if you cannot become root, then you will
probably not be able to use RPM installation, depending on how "rpm" is set
up).</li>

<li>Change to the directory containing the dopewars rpm, and install it with
the command<br />
<tt><b>rpm -Uvh dopewars-1.6.2-1.el7.x86_64.rpm</b></tt><br /> This will replace any
already-installed earlier version.</li>
</ol>

<h2><a id="rpmsource">RPM source installation</a></h2>
<p>This route is open to you if your system has "rpm", but the binary RPMs do
not work on your system, or your machine is not an Intel (an Alpha or PowerMac,
for example). It involves obtaining the RPM of the source code, and then
building the binaries from it on your system.</p>

<ol>
<li>Download the
<a href="http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/dopewars/dopewars-1.6.2-1.el7.src.rpm">
source code RPM</a>.</li>

<li>Become root and change to the directory containing the new rpm.</li>

<li>Build a binary rpm with the command<br />
<tt><b>rpmbuild --rebuild dopewars-1.6.2-1.el7.src.rpm</b></tt></li>

<li>Change to the directory which the binary rpm has been written to (check
the output of the above - usually /usr/src/redhat/RPMS/<i>xxx</i>, where
<i>xxx</i> is your machine type - for example, "i386" on Intel machines,
"alpha" on Alphas, "x86_64" on AMD64 or EM64T machines)</li>

<li>Install the binary rpm with the command<br />
<tt><b>rpm -Uvh dopewars-1.6.2-1.el7.<i>xxx</i>.rpm</b></tt></li>
</ol>

<h2><a id="tarball">Tarball installation</a></h2>
<p>If you don't have, or don't want to use, RPM, you can obtain the source code
in gzipped, tarred ("tarball") format and recompile and install it yourself.
This is also usually a necessity if you cannot become root (the superuser) on
your Unix box, or if you wish to build the Windows version from source code.</p>

<p>Before beginning, you should ensure that you have all the necessary
prequisites (see above). To compile on a Windows system, you will need
the MinGW compiler and libraries; see the
<a href="https://github.com/benmwebb/dopewars/tree/develop/win32">Windows-specific
build page</a> for more information.
</p>

<ol>
<li>Download the
<a href="http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/dopewars/dopewars-1.6.2.tar.gz">
source code tarball</a>.</li>

<li>Change to the directory containing the tarball and extract the contents
with the command <br />
<tt><b>tar -xvzf dopewars-1.6.2.tar.gz</b></tt><br />
(or similar).</li>

<li>Change into the dopewars-1.6.2 directory, and read all the important
documentation in there ;) Most notably, the INSTALL file gives more details
on setup and installation.</li>

<li>Build the binary with the commands<br />
<tt><b>./configure</b><br />
<b>make</b></tt></li>

<li>Become root and install the dopewars files with<br />
<tt><b>make install</b></tt><br />
<p>The configure script will test your system and set up dopewars so that it
should compile cleanly.  The configure script supports a number of
configurable options; for more details, read the INSTALL file in the
dopewars-1.6.2 directory.</p>

<p>If you cannot become root, run the configure script specifying directories
for which you have write access for the dopewars files, with a command
such as<br />
<tt><b>./configure --prefix=/home/user/dopewars</b></tt></p></li>
</ol>
