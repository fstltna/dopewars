<h1>dopewars: Location Options</h1>

<ul>
<li><b>Location</b>: A list of all locations in the game. Use the "New"
button to create a new location, or the "Delete", "Up" and "Down" buttons
to delete the currently selected location or to change its position in the
list. (You cannot delete all of the locations, as this would make the
game unplayable.) Selecting a location from this list allows the other
sections in this window to be filled in.<p /></li>

<li><b>Name</b>: The name of the region or city that the location represents.
<p /></li>

<li><b>Police presence</b>: The percentage chance that the police in this

set the minimum number of different types of drug that will be available in
this location.<p /></li>

<li><b>Maximum no. of drugs</b>: This allows you to set the maximum number of
different types of drug that will be available in this location.<p /></li>
