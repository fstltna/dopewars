<h1>dopewars: Server Options</h1>

<ul>
<li><b>Server reports to metaserver</b>: If checked, then when running the
dopewars server, it will report to the metaserver so that players can find
your server from the dopewars website or from the New Game dialog's Metaserver
tab. (If not checked, its existence will not be advertised, but people can
still connect to your server if they know the hostname and port number.)
<p /></li>

<li><b>Minimize to System Tray</b>: (Windows only) When running the
graphical server, and it is minimized, do not show the window in the normal
window list, but in the System Tray (the collection of small icons in the
bottom right of the screen). Clicking on the dopewars icon in the Tray will
restore the window to its normal state.<p /></li>

<li><b>Metaserver URL</b>: The full URL for the metaserver script, used by
both the server and client. You should not normally need to alter this.<p /></li>

<li><b>Comment</b>: A description of your dopewars server, which is sent to
the metaserver and can be used to tell potential clients the rough rules of
your game.<p /></li>

<li><b>MOTD (welcome message)</b>: The message of the day, sent to clients
when they connect to the server (can be used to tell them more about the setup
of the game).<p /></li>

</ul>
