<h1>dopewars: Drugs Options</h1>

<ul>
<li><b>Drug</b>: A list of all drugs in the game. Use the "New"
button to create a new drug, or the "Delete", "Up" and "Down" buttons
to delete the currently selected drug or to change its position in the
list. (You cannot delete all of the drugs, as this would make the
game unplayable.) Selecting a drug from this list allows the other
sections in this window to be filled in.<p /></li>

<li><b>Name</b>: The name of the drug.
<p /></li>

<li><b>Minimum normal price</b>: Sets the lowest price that this drug can
be offered at, under normal circumstances (i.e. there have been no drug busts
or other special events on this day).<p /></li>

<li><b>Maximum normal price</b>: Sets the highest price that this drug can
be offered at, under normal circumstances.<p /></li>

<li><b>Can be specially cheap</b>: If checked, then occasionally this drug
can be offered at a quarter of its usual price, due to some special event.
<p /></li>

<li><b>Cheap string</b>: If the previous checkbox is selected, then this is
the message that is displayed when this drug is offered cheaply - e.g.
"The market is flooded with cheap home-made acid!".<p /></li>

<li><b>Can be specially expensive</b>: If checked, then occasionally this drug
can be offered at four times its usual price, due to some special event.
<p /></li>

<li><b>Expensive string 1/2</b>: These two strings are used whenever <b>any</b>
drug is offered at the expensive price (one of the two messages is picked at
random). The name of the drug is substituted into the string for "%tde" - e.g.
"Addicts are buying %tde at ridiculous prices!" could be displayed as
"Addicts are buying Cocaine at ridiculous prices!".<p /></li>

</ul>
