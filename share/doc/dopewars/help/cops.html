<h1>dopewars: Cops Options</h1>

<ul>
<li><b>Cop</b>: A list of all cops in the game. Use the "New"
button to create a new cop, or the "Delete", "Up" and "Down" buttons
to delete the currently selected cop or to change its position in the
list. (If you delete all of the cops, then the cops will never attack
you.) Selecting a cop from this list allows the other
sections in this window to be filled in.<p /></li>

<li><b>Name</b>: The name of the cop.
<p /></li>

<li><b>Name of one deputy</b>: The name of one of the deputies or other
assistants that can accompany this cop.<p /></li>

<li><b>Name of several deputies</b>: The name of two or more of the deputies
or other assistants that can accompany this cop.<p /></li>

<li><b>Minimum no. of deputies</b>: The lowest number of deputies that can
accompany this cop. The more deputies, the harder it is to run away from or
to shoot the cop, and the more damage they do to you when they shoot.<p /></li>

<li><b>Maximum no. of deputies</b>: The highest number of deputies that can
accompany this cop.<p /></li>

<li><b>Cop armor</b>: A percentage value to determine how much damage the cop
takes when he is shot. A value of 100 means that if you do 10 damage, the cop
loses 10 health. A value of 200 means that he only loses 5 health, and a value
of 50 results in a loss of 20.<p /></li>

<li><b>Deputy armor</b>: A percentage value to determine how much damage each
deputy takes when he is shot.<p /></li>

</ul>
