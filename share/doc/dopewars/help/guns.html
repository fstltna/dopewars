<h1>dopewars: Guns Options</h1>

<ul>
<li><b>Gun</b>: A list of all guns in the game. Use the "New"
button to create a new gun, or the "Delete", "Up" and "Down" buttons
to delete the currently selected gun or to change its position in the
list. (If you delete all of the guns, then the cops will never attack
you, and you cannot attack other players or buy guns in the Gun Shop.)
Selecting a gun from this list allows the other
sections in this window to be filled in.<p /></li>

<li><b>Name</b>: The name of the gun.
<p /></li>

<li><b>Price</b>: The cost of the gun, if you buy it from the Gun Shop. (If
you are offered it during the course of the game on the street, then it is
offered at 10% of this price).
<p /></li>

<li><b>Inventory space</b>: The amount of space that this gun takes up in
your inventory.
<p /></li>

<li><b>Damage</b>: The maximum damage done by this gun, if you hit an enemy.
(The actual amount of health that they lose is also dependent on their armor
rating.)
<p /></li>

</ul>
