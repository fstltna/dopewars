<h1>Notes for developers</h1>

<p>You are free to make whatever changes to the code you wish, as long as you
abide by the terms set out in the <a href="LICENCE">GNU General
Public License</a>. Obviously, I only have a limited amount of time to devote
to dopewars development, and so encourage discussion of the dopewars code,
documentation and concept, and particularly welcome suggested improvements.</p>

<p>You are free to distribute modified versions of the code,
again subject to the license, but I also welcome additions to the code
via <a href="https://github.com/benmwebb/dopewars/pulls">pull requests</a>.
If I choose to include this code in a new dopewars version, you will of
course be credited in the changelog (unless, of course, you don't want to
be).</p>

<p>If you wish to write your own client to connect to a dopewars server, then
you need to understand the protocol that dopewars uses, which is
documented <a href="protocol.html">here</a>.</p>

<p>The definitive source on the internal workings of the dopewars game code
is the source code itself. It is not exactly "self-documenting", but I have
endeavoured to add sufficient documentation to the source where necessary;
any discussion here of the internal workings, however, may be incomplete, out
of date, and possibly misleading. Feel free to
<a href="https://github.com/benmwebb/dopewars/issues">open an issue</a>
with questions on this; I might possibly even know the answers!</p>
