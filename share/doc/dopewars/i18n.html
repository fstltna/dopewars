<h1>Internationalization</h1>

<p>dopewars uses the <a href="http://www.gnu.org/manual/gettext/">GNU
gettext</a> utilities for internationalization (i18n) support. This allows the
software to be translated into the local language at runtime - run dopewars in
the UK and it'll talk to you in English, but run it in Germany and it'll talk
to you in German. This relies on translators to translate the program's output
into each language beforehand, of course, and so native language speakers to
carry out this task are always needed!</p>

<h2><a id="running">Running dopewars with i18n support</a></h2>
<p>i18n is only included in versions of dopewars later than 1.4.8. By default,
"Native Language Support" is compiled in; binary installations should be
already set up for i18n. When compiling dopewars from source code, the
<tt>configure</tt> script should detect whether your system can support
GNU gettext. To disable i18n,
pass the <tt>--disable-nls</tt> option to the <tt>configure</tt> script.</p>

<p>When you run your installed copy of dopewars, it should detect your "locale"
automatically and talk to you in your native language. If this does not happen,
the following are some possible explanations:-</p>
<ul>
<li>dopewars cannot find the locale-specific language file - by default, stored
under /usr/local/share/locale/</li>
<li>Your language is not yet supported - why not add it yourself?</li>
<li>Your system does not have locale support.</li>
<li>On a Windows system, you need to select the language from the relevant
section of Control Panel (or set the LANG environment variable, below). i18n
under Windows is only supported by version 1.5.3 and later.</li>
<li>You haven't set an environment variable to specify your locale (usually
this is done automatically). For example, if you're using the <tt>bash</tt>
shell and want a German translation, the command "<tt>export LANG=de_DE</tt>"
should ensure that dopewars (and all other i18n-aware programs launched from
this shell) will use the German language.</li>
</ul>

<h2><a id="adding">Adding a new translation</a></h2>
<p>Translation files are kept in the subdirectory <tt>po/</tt> of the dopewars
source code distribution. They are named by
<a href="http://userpage.chemie.fu-berlin.de/diverse/doc/ISO_639.html">
2-letter language codes</a> followed by the <tt>.po</tt> extension - for
example, the German translation is stored in the file <tt>po/de.po</tt>.
They are simple text files, consisting of lists of the original English string
(labelled by "msgid") followed by the translated string (labelled by
"msgstr").</p>

<p>To add a new translation, first
<a href="installation.html">install dopewars from source code</a>. This will
generate the reference file <tt>dopewars.pot</tt> in the <tt>po</tt>
subdirectory. Then, copy <tt>dopewars.pot</tt> to your language-specific
<tt>.po</tt> file in the
<tt>po/</tt> directory, and fill in the "msgstr" entries. Once this is done,
edit the <tt>configure.ac</tt> file in the top dopewars directory to add your
language code to the <tt>ALL_LINGUAS</tt> variable. Then run <tt>autoconf</tt>
to rebuild the <tt>configure</tt> script, before making and installing dopewars
as usual. The new translation should now be available. Once this is complete,
please <a href="https://github.com/benmwebb/dopewars/pulls">open a pull
request</a> to have the translation included in the next dopewars version.</p>

<p>Please note that some strings are <b>format strings</b> containing the %
character. These are used in the program code for substituting numbers and
other pieces of text into the string - these substitutions are are performed
using variables which are specified in the <b>same order</b> as the %
characters in the format string. For example, the following format string
substitutes in a string (%s) and an integer number (%d):-<br />
<tt>"String '%s' has %d characters"</tt><br />
The string and number are specified in order in the code. This is problematic
if your translation changes the order - for example, a valid German translation
of the string would be<br />
<tt>"%d Zeichen lang ist die Zeichenkette '%s'"</tt><br />
Now the number and string are specified in the wrong order, and this will
probably crash the program on running! To fix this, use the special notation<br />
<tt>"%2$d Zeichen lang ist die Zeichenkette '%1$s'"</tt><br />
(i.e. replace <b>%x</b> with <b>%n$x</b> where <b>n</b> is the index that the
format specifier "should" have, starting from 1.)</p>

<h2><a id="dopespec">dopewars specifics</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>When questions are asked in the curses (text mode) client, the keys that
you are allowed to press in reply are stored in a string. This should be
translated to suitable keys in your language, in the <b>same</b> order as 
the original - e.g. "<tt>YN</tt>" (for Yes/No) could be translated in German
to "<tt>JN</tt>" (for Ja/Nein).<p /></li>

<li>When a dopewars server asks a client a question, the valid replies are
sent at the start of the message, followed by a "<tt>^</tt>" character. These
replies define the dopewars protocol, and so should <b>not</b> be
translated - they will prevent clients and servers from talking to each other
properly. So for example, the string "<tt>YN^Would you like to visit %s?</tt>"
should be translated as you wish, but with the "<tt>YN^</tt>" at the start
left unchanged.<p /></li>

<li>The <tt>%txx</tt> notation is used for "translated strings". This notation
is exactly equivalent to the standard C "<tt>%s</tt>" notation for a string,
and does essentially the same thing, except that the two-letter code which
follows the <tt>%t</tt> is used to select an "alternative form" of the word
- for example, your language may have different words for "bitch" depending
on whether the word is the subject or the object of the sentence. You are
free to translate <tt>%txx</tt> to use the most appropriate form of the word.
If you wish to capitalise the first letter of the word (as used in English for
titles, etc.) then use "<tt>%T</tt>" rather than "<tt>%t</tt>".<p />

<p>Obviously dopewars cannot guess what your "alternative forms" are; you must
specify them yourself. Essentially, when setting a string in a dopewars
configuration file (or the defaults, which are set in dopewars.c) alternative
forms can be added by alternating two-letter codes and alternative forms after
the original word, separating them by _ (underline) symbols. For example,<br />
<tt>Names.Bitch = "bitch_no_bitcho_ac_bitche"</tt><br />
specifies two alternative forms for "bitch", identified by the "<tt>no</tt>"
and "<tt>ac</tt>" codes. You can then use "bitcho" anywhere that "bitch" is
normally used by translating the relevant string as "<tt>%tno</tt>" (and to
get "bitche" use "<tt>%tac</tt>"). If you specify a two letter code
in the translation that you haven't given an alternative form for, the
default word ("bitch") will be used. In the original English, "<tt>%tde</tt>"
is used for this purpose, but there is nothing special about the "<tt>de</tt>"
code - you can use it yourself if you like, and you can use as many
different two-letter codes as you want to.</p>

<p>For a good working example of the "<tt>%tde</tt>" notation, see the
Norwegian Nynorsk translation (<tt>nn.po</tt>).</p>

<p>Additionally, prices in dopewars are automatically formatted into strings by
means of the %P notation, and comments can be introduced into format strings
by means of the %/.../ notation. Everything between the two / characters is
not printed. This is used to "qualify" some strings for translation, and the
%/.../ can be left out of the translated string if desired (the comment does
not need to be translated).</p>
</li>

</ul>

<h2><a id="updating">Updating a translation for a new dopewars
version</a></h2>

<p>New versions of dopewars will often change what is printed to the user, and
so may may require changes to the translation. To update an existing
translation, change into the <tt>po</tt> subdirectory of the dopewars
source code, and do a "<tt>make dopewars.pot</tt>". This creates the
<tt>dopewars.pot</tt> file, which lists the strings that need translating.
Next, create a new translation file from your "old" translation file (we'll
assume it's called <tt>de.po</tt>) and <tt>dopewars.pot</tt> with the
<tt>msgmerge</tt> command:-<br />
<tt>msgmerge -o newfile de.po dopewars.pot</tt><br />
Examine this new file <tt>newfile</tt> for translations that need updating
(a search for "fuzzy" should find most of them) and then overwrite your old
translation with the new one:<br />
<tt>mv newfile de.po</tt><br />
Rebuild and reinstall dopewars, and the new translations should become
available. Again, it is deeply appreciated if such updated files are
contributed to the main dopewars distribution!</p>
