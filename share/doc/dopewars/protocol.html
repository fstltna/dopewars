<h2><a id="syntax">Syntax used in this document</a></h2>

<dl>
<dt><tt>(runhere)</tt></dt>
<dd>A single character field (equivalent to C's %c format).</dd>

<dt><tt>&lt;ID&gt;</tt></dt>
<dd>A numeric field - an integer printed in text form, without spaces, commas
or other punctuation. Note that the number is not stored directly as its
binary representation, but as a string - i.e. "100" takes 3 characters
(bytes), not one. Equivalent to C's %d format.</dd>

<dt><tt>"text"</tt></dt>
<dd>Freeform text, equivalent to C's %s format.</dd>

</dl>

<p>Anything else should be taken as literal characters, which should appear in
the message exactly as printed here.</p>

<h2><a id="format">General message format</a></h2>

<p>dopewars clients communicate with the dopewars server by means of a TCP/IP
connection. Messages are sent in plain text, are of variable length, and
are always terminated by a linefeed character ('\n', ASCII code 10)</p>

<p>Messages themselves are typically split into 'words', delimited by the caret
(^) character. The underline character (_) is also used to break up
translatable strings (tstrings), if the <a href="#tstring">A_TSTRING</a>
ability is active, and thus these two characters, together with the \n
character, should normally be avoided in message data.</p>

<p>Messages are usually of the format:-</p>

<dl>
<dt><tt>&lt;ID&gt;^(A)(C)"data"</tt></dt>
<dd><tt>ID</tt> = player ID (may also be blank if this is not applicable)<br />
<tt>A</tt> = one-letter message subtype code (used by AI players)<br />
<tt>C</tt> = one-letter message type code<br />
<tt>data</tt> = message-dependent information</dd>
</dl>

<p>e.g. "1^AFHello player"</p>

<p>If ID is not specified, it should be left blank when sending to the server,
and should be ignored in reading messages from the server.</p>

<p>The "data" field often contains multiple items, separated by ^ characters.
Note that the last field in such a message should <b>not</b> be assumed to be
terminated by the message terminator, \n - although it always will be, it
should also be first terminated by the field separator, the ^ character.
This allows the client to ignore extra fields, if later versions
of the protocol should add them. (N.B. This does not apply to free-form text
fields, as in the C_QUESTION, C_PRINTMESSAGE, C_MSG, C_MSGTO, and C_FIGHTPRINT
messages, which _do_ extend to the end of the message; for these messages,
the caret is generally interpreted as a line break.) Note also that older
servers may not send all the fields, so if fewer fields than expected are
received, the client should substitute default values.</p>

<p>Message codes are shown below, together with the symbolic constants used in
the dopewars code for clarity (e.g. the 'A' code is represented by
C_PRINTMESSAGE)</p>

<p>For the AI codes, see the AICode type in src/message.h</p>

<p><a id="oldprotocol">N.B. Older versions of dopewars used a less
sophisticated protocol:-</a></p>

<dl>
<dt><tt>"From"^"To"^(A)(C)"data"</tt></dt>
<dd><tt>A</tt>, <tt>C</tt>, and <tt>data</tt> are the same; however
<tt>"From"</tt> and <tt>"To"</tt> are the player <b>names</b> (not IDs) of
the players that the message is coming from and going to. Again, these can
often be left blank. This old protocol is used if the
<a href="#playerid">A_PLAYERID</a> ability is not present.</dd>
</dl>

<p>e.g. "Fred^Bert^AFHello player"</p>

<h2><a id="startgame">Starting a game from the client</a></h2>

<p>To start a game, the client must first notify the server of the protocol
it can support (with the <a href="#abilities">C_ABILITIES</a> message) and
then provide a suitable player name (with the <a href="#name">C_NAME</a>
message). Note that both of these messages must be sent using the
<a href="#oldprotocol">old protocol</a>, as before protocol negotiation is
complete (both server and client have sent a C_ABILITIES message) the server
will default to using this protocol, for backwards compatibility. After sending
these two messages, the game is run mainly by the server; the client should
listen for incoming messages, and respond appropriately.</p>

<h2><a id="refserver">Server to client message reference</a></h2>

<p>The messages listed below may be sent from a dopewars server to the client.
Most of these messages require some kind of processing to be done, and may
require a response. The client cannot safely ignore such messages, as the
server will not "retry" if the client does not respond.</p>

<dl>

<dt><b>C_PRINTMESSAGE</b> ('<tt>A</tt>')</dt>
<dd>Sent when the server wishes the client to display some text<br />
<tt>data</tt> = The text that the client should display; any ^ delimiters in
this text should be taken to mean a new line.<br />
e.g. "^AAGame over^You made the high score list"<br />
<b>Answer required:</b> no<p /></dd>

<dt><b>C_LIST</b> ('<tt>B</tt>')</dt>
<dd>Used by the server to tell the client about other logged on players<br />
<tt>data</tt> = <tt>"name"^&lt;ID&gt;</tt><br />
<tt>name</tt> = the name of the player<br />
<tt>ID</tt> = the numeric ID that should be used to communicate with this
player<br />
e.g. "^ABFred^1"<br />

<dt><b>C_ENDLIST</b> ('<tt>C</tt>')</dt>
<dd>Signals that all players have been listed (no more C_LIST messages to
come)<br />
e.g. "^AC"<br />
<b>Answer required:</b> no<p /></dd>

<dt><b>C_NEWNAME</b> ('<tt>D</tt>')</dt>
<dd>Signals that the name provided by the client is unsuitable (usually, this
is because it's already been taken by another player)<br />
N.B. This is always sent at the start of the game, before protocol negotiation,
so uses the old format, e.g. "^^AD"<br />
<b>Answer required:</b> yes - must send a suitable C_NAME message to
proceed<p /></dd>

<dt><b>C_MSG</b> ('<tt>E</tt>')</dt>
<dd>Contains a message from one player (or the server admin) broadcast to all
connected players.<br />

e.g. "1^AHFred"<br />
<b>Answer required:</b> no<p /></dd>

<dt><b>C_SUBWAYFLASH</b> ('<tt>I</tt>')</dt>
<dd>Used by the server to tell a client that it has just moved to a new
location. (The client is not told where this location is, since this
information is contained in a C_UPDATE message.) Clients usually reset any
location-dependent state (e.g. fights) on receiving this message, and flash
a "subway" indicator or similar<br />
e.g. "^AI"<br />
<b>Answer required:</b> no<p /></dd>

<dt><b>C_UPDATE</b> ('<tt>J</tt>')</dt>
<dd>Used by the server to update client state. This is also used to tell the
player about the state of another player (a report from a spy)<br />

the individual binary bits. The only one currently used is SPYINGON (16) which
is set if the player is currently spying on one or more other players<br />
<tt>GUNS</tt> = the numbers of each gun carried, separated by ^ characters
(there should be NumGun numbers in this list - see the C_INIT message)<br />
<tt>DRUGS</tt> = similar, for carried drugs<br />
<tt>DRUGVALUE</tt> = similar, but contains the total cash value of each drug;
N.B. this field is only sent if the ability
<a href="#drugvalue">A_DRUGVALUE</a> is present<br />

<dd>Used to display a message from the server that requires a response<br />
<tt>data</tt> = <tt>"keys"^"message"</tt><br />
<tt>keys</tt> = a list of the valid single-character responses - e.g. "YN" for
a yes/no question; the client may use these keys directly, or expand them to
complete words (e.g. YN -> Yes/No)<br />

e.g. "^AR"<br />
<b>Answer required:</b> no<p /></dd>

<dt><b>C_ENDHISCORE</b> ('<tt>S</tt>')</dt>
<dd>Tells the client that the server has sent all of the high scores; usually
used by the client to display a prompt to end the game (if data="end") or to
return to the game (if data is not "end")<br />
<tt>data</tt> = "end" if the game has finished, blank otherwise<br />

<p><a id="playerid"><tt>playerid</tt></a> = '1' if we use player IDs rather
than player names to identify players in network messages ('0' otherwise). It is
strongly recommended that this new protocol be used, as the old protocol is
difficult to properly support, and is deprecated. However, the new protocol is
only supported by servers of version 1.5.0 or above. (N.B. Since the old
protocol does not support the C_ABILITIES message either, before the client and
server have exchanged C_ABILITIES messages the server will "talk" using the old
protocol. Thus, the C_ABILITIES message itself from the client, and any
succeeding messages sent before the server sends C_ABILITIES back, must be
sent using the old protocol. "Old" servers will ignore the C_ABILITIES
message.) Ability name in dopewars code: <b>A_PLAYERID</b></p>

<p><a id="drugvalue"><tt>drugvalue</tt></a> = '1' if the server should keep
track of how much players paid for their drugs, so that they can see whether
they're getting a good deal when they come to sell them ('0' otherwise).
Ability name in dopewars code: <b>A_DRUGVALUE</b></p>

<p><a id="newfight"><tt>newfight</tt></a> = '1' if we use the "new" fighting
interface (documented here). Highly recommended. Ability name in dopewars
code: <b>A_NEWFIGHT</b></p>

<p><a id="tstring"><tt>tstring</tt></a> = '1' if names of drugs etc. should be
sent in the <a href="i18n.html">translated string</a> (tstring) notation;
only necessary if you are supporting non-English languages. Ability name
in dopewars code: <b>A_TSTRING</b></p>

<p><a id="donefight"><tt>donefight</tt></a> = '1' if, when a fight finishes,
the client is expected to send a C_DONE message to instruct the server to
move on. (This is to allow the user to close the fight dialog before any
new dialogs pop up.) Ability name in dopewars code: <b>A_DONEFIGHT</b></p>

<p><a id="utf8"><tt>utf8</tt></a> = '1' if all strings are sent over the
network in UTF-8 (Unicode) encoding, rather than an encoding specific to
the locale of the server or client. Ability name in dopewars code:
<b>A_UTF8</b></p>

<p><a id="date"><tt>date</tt></a> = '1' if the C_INIT message sends/receives
the Names.Date variable, rather than Names.Month and Names.Year as older
versions used to. Ability name in dopewars code: <b>A_DATE</b></p>

<p><b>N.B.</b> Only seven abilities are listed here. Older servers or clients
may not only not support some of these abilities, they may not even know
of their existence (conversely, newer versions may add new abilities). Thus
all servers and clients, if passed an unexpectedly short abilities string,
should pad it out with zeroes. If passed a long string, it should be truncated.
This will cause these extra (or unspecified) abilities to be unsupported.
(The order of the abilities string should never change.)</p>

e.g. "^^Ar1010000" (N.B. the double ^ is a feature of the "old" protocol)</dd>

format should be used, e.g. "^^AcFred"<p /></dd>

<dt><b>C_SACKBITCH</b> ('<tt>d</tt>')</dt>
<dd>Requests that a bitch should be sacked<br />
e.g. "^Ad"<p /></dd>

<dt><b>C_TIPOFF</b> ('<tt>e</tt>')</dt>
<dd>Asks the server to tip off the cops to another player<br />
<tt>ID</tt> = the player ID to tip off the cops to<br />
e.g. "1^Ae"<p /></dd>

<dt><b>C_SPYON</b> ('<tt>f</tt>')</dt>
<dd>Asks the server to spy on another player<br />
<tt>ID</tt> = the player ID to spy on<br />
e.g. "1^Af"<p /></dd>

<dt><b>C_WANTQUIT</b> ('<tt>g</tt>')</dt>
<dd>Tells the server that the client wishes to leave the game early<br />
e.g. "^Ag"<p /></dd>

<dt><b>C_CONTACTSPY</b> ('<tt>h</tt>')</dt>
<dd>Asks the server to send back reports about all the players that we are
currently spying on<br />
e.g. "^Ah"<p /></dd>

<dt><b>C_REQUESTSCORE</b> ('<tt>j</tt>')</dt>
<dd>Asks the server to send back the high score list<br />
e.g. "^Aj"<p /></dd>

<dt><b>C_FIGHTACT</b> ('<tt>n</tt>')</dt>
<dd>Responds to a previous C_FIGHTPRINT message<br />
<tt>data</tt> = "<tt>F</tt>", "<tt>S</tt>", or "<tt>R</tt>"<br />
<tt>F</tt> = return fire<br />
<tt>S</tt> = stand and take it (do not return fire)<br />
<tt>R</tt> = try to run away<br />
N.B. If "runhere" is not set in the C_FIGHTPRINT message, the "R" response
should not be sent - a C_REQUESTJET message should be sent instead.<br />
e.g. "^AnF"<p /></dd>

<dt><b>C_ABILITIES</b> ('<tt>r</tt>')</dt>
<dd>Notifies the server of supported protocol features. See the explanation
for the corresponding <a href="#abilities">server message</a>.

<p>The client will receive this message in response to a previous C_ABILITIES
message that it sent to the server. This reply message contains the abilities
that the server is willing to support. The client should compare these to
those that it previously offered, and then use only those abilities that both
client and server support. (If the server does not support the new protocol,
no C_ABILITIES reply message will be sent, and the client should assume that
<b>no</b> abilities are supported.) The server will expect all client messages
after the C_ABILITIES message to be compliant with these abilities.</p>

e.g.<br />
- client sends "1110111" (supports everything except
<a href="#tstring">A_TSTRING</a>)<br />
- server responds with "1011011" (supports everything except
<a href="#drugvalue">A_DRUGVALUE</a> and
<a href="#donefight">A_DONEFIGHT</a>)<br />
- client should adopt the abilities "1010011"
(<a href="#playerid">A_PLAYERID</a> and <a href="#newfight">A_NEWFIGHT</a>)</dd>
